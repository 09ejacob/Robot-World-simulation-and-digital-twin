# Robot World simulation and digital twin - Bachelor group 9 2025

An extension for [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) for simulating Solwr's [Grab](https://solwr.com/products/grab) robot. This is a Bachelor's thesis done during the [IDATA2900](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2900#tab=omEmnet) course.

## Importing the Extension

1. In the root folder of Issac Sim: clone this repository in a new folder within the `extsUser` folder.
2. Go to the extensions window in Isaac Sim and search for the `Grab Digital Twin` extension.
3. Enable the extension. *(It is also possible to enable auto loading so that it always loads upon launching Isaac Sim)*
4. A new tab in the toolbar called `Grab Digital Twin` should appear.

NOTE: ***Make sure that the folder for the extension does not contain any triple-dashes (`---`), since these will cause an error in Isaac Sim and make the import unsuccessful.***
